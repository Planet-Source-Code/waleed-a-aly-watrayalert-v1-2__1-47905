This control raises several errors. For proper testing, error handling has been added to the DEMO.
SO.. You must either:

1. Compile the Project Group and Run the compiled DEMO, OR ..
2. If you prefer to Run the DEMO in the IDE, then set the 'Error Trapping' option of VB to 'Break on Unhandled Errors'.
    Else, VB will Break Execution on errors that are handled already in the DEMO.
    For changing the option, go to the following menu: Tools > Options > General Tab
